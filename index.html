          Gimbo & Kaa are two goblins living in a cave.
          One day, they receive a letter from the goblin IRS, stating that they owe 700 rubies to the government, and if they don't pay, their cave will be repossessed.
          Coincidentally, there's an advertisement in the New Goblin Times that there is a wizard tournament happening nearby, with a prize of 700 rubies!
          Knowing that this is the only way to pay their goblin taxes, they do what anyone would in this situation: kill a wizard and steal his kit.
          There's just one problem: they have no idea how to use the wizard's gear.
